>>> Attack Graph (AG) Security Atlas <<<
----------------------------------------
Goal: Capture articles within the domain of attack/threat modeling, graphs and simulation

RQ1: Find the social communities
RQ2: Find if publications on journal are acase
RQ3: Focus on the methods used by the mostly cited articles, which is the best work done (and used)?
